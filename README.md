# Responsive Club Website
Codecademy Off-Platform Project: Responsive Club Website

## Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

## Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!​


## Developer Notes:

* This is a responsive website that was created using grid and flexbox.
* This is an interactive website, where javascript was introduced along with DOM events to make the website a SPA.
* This is an Off-Platform Project which was created using Visual Studio Code and Chrome DevTools.
* https://unsplash.com was the main resource for the images.
